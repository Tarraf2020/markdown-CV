# ABOUT 
```
Hello, my name is Ali Tarraf born in 1998. I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have allowed me to put what I’ve learned in the
classroom into use in a practical sense. I want to work hard and surpass my limits
so I can prove to the world that hard work has WELL RESULTS. My passion for
helping others has been evident in my involvement what I had worked before.
Through those experiences I have learned to interact with a diverse group of
people, which has increased my ability to relate to others.
